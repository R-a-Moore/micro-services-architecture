    <h2>Relevant Work Experience</h2>
        <p>From the 23rd of July through to the 31st of August 2018, I was a paid intern at Derivco Ipswich where I learnt how to program in C# and learnt work in a professional environment. By the end of the internship, I took part in a team project to develop an online library for the company’s learning resources.
            In 2016 July, I took a work experience course in the Insurance Marsh & McLennan Companies, central London. There I learned how to work in a team and to contribute to a project at set deadlines.</p>
    <h2>Other Work Experience & Achievements</h2>
        <p>In 2009, I took part in a public speaking competition. Standing before a crowd and confidently doing my part within the team to present our case. In March 2015, I partook in a public speaking session, which educated me on how to present myself to an audience in a proper fashion. 
            In August 2016, I participated in the National Citizens Service (NCS), which teaches young people how to work together using communication and problem solving to complete tasks. Within the 3rd and 4th weeks, the group gives back to the community by creating a project to work on to help the community.

    <h2>personal Interests</h2>
        <p>I am particularly interested in computers and have constructed my own one in August 
            2017, purchasing the components and putting them together as well as installing the software. This was enjoyable and aided in my learning about computers in general, convincing me this was the field for me. 
            In my spare time I enjoy learning about new threats, vulnerabilities and attacks that evolve in the security sphere. I also spend a little time developing code for small projects that I find enjoyable such as keyloggers and encryption tools.</p>
